        <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
        <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes information (data) according to instructions (software). It can store, retrieve, and process data, making it possible to perform tasks like writing documents, browsing the internet, playing games, and much more. Computers come in many forms: desktops, laptops, tablets, and even smartphones.</p>
        <h2>Understanding Hardware</h2>
        <p><strong>Hardware</strong> refers to the physical parts of a computer—the things you can touch. Here are the main components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The "brain" of the computer. It processes instructions and manages tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Short-term memory that stores data and programs currently in use. More RAM means your computer can handle more tasks at once.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage (HDD/SSD):</strong> Where your files, programs, and operating system are kept. SSDs are faster and more reliable than traditional hard drives (HDDs).</li>
            <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board connecting all components.</li>
            <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Converts electricity from the wall into power for your computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphics Card (GPU):</strong> Handles images, videos, and graphics. Essential for gaming, design, and video editing.</li>
            <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Keyboard, mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen—used to interact with your computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Monitor (screen), speakers, printer—used to display or output information.</li>
            <li><strong>Ports & Connectivity:</strong> USB ports, HDMI, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and more for connecting devices and networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is Software?</h2>
        <p><strong>Software</strong> is a set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. Without software, hardware is useless. There are many types of software, each serving different purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operating System (OS):</strong> The core software that manages hardware and allows you to run other programs. Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Programs that help you perform specific tasks. Examples:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Word Processors:</strong> Microsoft Word, Google Docs (for writing documents)</li>
                    <li><strong>Spreadsheets:</strong> Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets (for calculations and data analysis)</li>
                    <li><strong>Email Clients:</strong> Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari</li>
                    <li><strong>Media Players:</strong> VLC, Windows Media Player</li>
                    <li><strong>Photo & Video Editors:</strong> Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, iMovie</li>
                    <li><strong>Accounting Software:</strong> QuickBooks, Sage</li>
                    <li><strong>Antivirus & Security:</strong> Norton, Kaspersky, Windows Defender</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> Tools that help maintain, analyze, and optimize your computer. Examples: Disk cleanup tools, backup software, file compression tools (WinRAR, 7-Zip).</li>
            <li><strong>Device Drivers:</strong> Special software that lets your operating system communicate with hardware (like printers, graphics cards, or Wi-Fi adapters).</li>
            <li><strong>Programming Software:</strong> Tools for creating new software. Examples: Visual Studio Code, Python, Java, C++ compilers.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Software designed for smartphones and tablets. Examples: WhatsApp, Instagram, banking apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Software:</strong> Apps and services accessed via the internet. Examples: Google Drive, Dropbox, Office 365.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Basic Computer Maintenance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update your operating system and apps to fix security holes and improve performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Antivirus & Anti-Malware:</strong> Protect your computer from viruses and other threats. Run regular scans.</li>
            <li><strong>Back Up Your Data:</strong> Use an external drive or cloud storage to back up important files. This protects you from data loss due to hardware failure or malware.</li>
            <li><strong>Clean Your Hardware:</strong> Dust can cause overheating. Gently clean your keyboard, screen, and vents. Turn off and unplug your computer before cleaning.</li>
            <li><strong>Uninstall Unused Programs:</strong> Remove software you no longer need to free up space and improve speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Storage Space:</strong> Keep at least 10-20% of your drive free for best performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Restart Regularly:</strong> Restarting your computer can fix minor issues and keep things running smoothly.</li>
        </ul>
