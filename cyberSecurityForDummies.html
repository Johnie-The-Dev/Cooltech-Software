        <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters for Everyone</h2>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is about protecting your digital life—your devices, your data, your money, and your identity—from criminals and scammers. In our connected world, almost everything we do leaves a digital footprint: shopping, banking, chatting, working, and even relaxing. Cybercriminals target everyone, not just big companies. If you use a smartphone, computer, or the internet, you are a potential target. The good news? You don’t need to be a tech expert to stay safe. This guide will help you understand the risks and give you practical steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.

        <h2>Understanding Cyber Threats: What Are You Up Against?</h2>
        <div class="threat">
            <div class="threat-title">Phishing</div>
            <div class="threat-desc">Phishing is when scammers send fake emails, texts, or social media messages that look real, trying to trick you into giving away passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive info. Some even create fake websites that look like your bank or favorite shop.</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Look for poor spelling, urgent or threatening language, or suspicious links. Check the sender’s email address carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Never click on links or download attachments from unknown senders. If in doubt, contact the company directly using a trusted phone number or website.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="threat">
            <div class="threat-title">Malware & Ransomware</div>
            <div class="threat-desc">Malware is malicious software that can infect your device, steal your data, or even lock your files and demand a ransom (ransomware). It can come from infected email attachments, fake downloads, or even malicious ads.</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Slow device performance, unexpected pop-ups, or files you can’t open.</li>
                <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Don’t download software from untrusted websites. Keep your operating system and apps updated. Use reputable antivirus software and run regular scans.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="threat">
            <div class="threat-title">Weak & Reused Passwords</div>
            <div class="threat-desc">Using simple passwords (like "123456" or "password") or reusing the same password everywhere makes it easy for hackers to break into your accounts. If one site is hacked, all your accounts are at risk.</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How to spot it:</strong> If you use the same password for multiple sites, you’re at risk.</li>
                <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Use strong, unique passwords for every account. Consider a password manager to keep track of them.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="threat">
            <div class="threat-title">Public Wi-Fi Risks</div>
            <div class="threat-desc">Free Wi-Fi in cafes, airports, or hotels is convenient but often insecure. Hackers can intercept your data or set up fake Wi-Fi networks to steal your information.</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Any open Wi-Fi network without a password is risky. Even password-protected public Wi-Fi can be unsafe.</li>
                <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Avoid accessing sensitive accounts (like banking) on public Wi-Fi. Use a VPN if you must use public networks. Turn off Wi-Fi when you’re not using it.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="threat">
            <div class="threat-title">Social Engineering & Scams</div>
            <div class="threat-desc">Social engineering is when scammers use psychological tricks—like pretending to be your boss, a friend, or a tech support agent—to get you to reveal information or send money.</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Unusual requests, urgent demands, or offers that seem too good to be true.</li>
                <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Pause and think before responding. Verify requests by contacting the person or company directly using a known number or email.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="threat">
            <div class="threat-title">Identity Theft</div>
            <div class="threat-desc">Identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information (like your ID number, credit card, or social security number) to commit fraud or open accounts in your name.</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How to spot it:</strong> Unexpected bills, credit card charges, or notifications about accounts you didn’t open.</li>
                <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Shred sensitive documents, monitor your accounts, and use strong privacy settings online.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>10 Essential Habits for Staying Safe Online</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Make passwords long (at least 12 characters), with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Don’t use personal info like birthdays or pet names.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> This adds a second step (like a code sent to your phone) when logging in. It makes it much harder for hackers to access your accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep Software & Devices Updated:</strong> Updates fix security holes. Turn on automatic updates for your phone, computer, and apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Wary of Suspicious Emails, Calls & Links:</strong> Don’t click links or download attachments from unknown sources. If you get a call from your “bank,” hang up and call them back using the official number.</li>
            <li><strong>Back Up Your Data Regularly:</strong> Use cloud storage or an external drive. If you’re hit by ransomware, you won’t lose everything.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Antivirus & Anti-Malware Tools:</strong> Even free versions offer good protection. Keep them updated and run regular scans.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Your Home Wi-Fi:</strong> Change the default password on your router, use strong encryption (WPA2 or WPA3), and don’t share your Wi-Fi password with strangers.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit What You Share Online:</strong> Be careful with personal info on social media—scammers use it to guess passwords or target you. Don’t overshare your location, travel plans, or daily routines.</li>
            <li><strong>Log Out of Accounts When Done:</strong> Especially on shared or public computers. Always log out of banking, email, and social media.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts & Ask for Help:</strong> If something feels wrong, it probably is. Don’t be afraid to ask a trusted friend or professional for advice.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> <br>
            Use a password manager to create and store strong passwords. It’s safer and easier than trying to remember them all yourself. Many are free or low-cost.
        </div>
        <h2>Protecting Your Devices: Step-by-Step</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep everything updated:</strong> Install updates for your operating system, browser, and apps as soon as they’re available.</li>
            <li><strong>Download apps only from official stores:</strong> (Google Play, Apple App Store, Microsoft Store). Avoid “cracked” or pirated software.</li>
            <li><strong>Set up a screen lock:</strong> Use a PIN, password, or biometrics (fingerprint/face) on your phone and computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Encrypt your devices:</strong> Most modern phones and computers offer encryption—turn it on in your settings for extra protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t leave devices unattended:</strong> In public places, keep your devices with you or locked up.</li>
            <li><strong>Be careful with USB drives:</strong> Don’t plug in unknown USB sticks—they can carry malware.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Safe Social Media & Messaging</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Review your privacy settings:</strong> Limit who can see your posts and personal info. Set your profiles to “friends only” where possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Be careful with friend requests:</strong> Only accept people you know. Scammers often create fake profiles.</li>
            <li><strong>Think before you post:</strong> Once it’s online, it’s hard to take back. Avoid sharing sensitive info or photos you wouldn’t want public.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch out for scams in DMs:</strong> Don’t click on links or send money to people you don’t know—even if they claim to be a friend in trouble.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Shopping & Banking Online Safely</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shop on secure websites:</strong> Look for “https://” and a padlock icon in your browser’s address bar.</li>
            <li><strong>Use credit cards or trusted payment services:</strong> They offer better fraud protection than debit cards or wire transfers.</li>
            <li><strong>Never share your PIN or passwords:</strong> No legitimate company will ask for them.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor your accounts:</strong> Check your bank and credit card statements regularly for suspicious activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What To Do If You Think You’ve Been Hacked</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Change your passwords immediately:</strong> Start with your email and bank accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Run a full antivirus scan:</strong> Remove any malware or suspicious programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact your bank or service provider:</strong> If you notice suspicious activity, let them know right away.</li>
            <li><strong>Let friends and family know:</strong> Warn them if your accounts may have been used to send spam or scams.</li>
            <li><strong>Report the incident:</strong> Many countries have cybercrime hotlines or websites where you can report fraud or identity theft.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Remember:</strong> <br>
            Cybersecurity isn’t about being perfect—it’s about making yourself a harder target. Every small step you take makes a big difference!
